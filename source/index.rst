Spatial Data Science with R
============================

The materials presented here teach spatial data analysis and modeling with *R*. *R* is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. *R* also provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing spatial data for spatial modeling. 

If you have never used *R*, or if you need a refresher, you should start with our `Introduction to R <intr/index.html>`__ (`pdf </pdf/Rintro.pdf>`__)

There are two version of this website, the `"raster" version </raster/index.html>`_ and the `"terra" version </terra/index.html>`_. The "raster" version is well established and more elaborate. If in doubt, go there. 

The version using the "terra" package is new, and under development. It is particularly useful for those who are interested in switching from the `raster` to the `terra` package, for faster processing and for remote sensing.
