Spatial Data Science with R
============================

The materials presented here teach spatial data analysis and modeling with *R*. *R* is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. *R* also provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing spatial data for spatial modeling. 

If you have never used *R*, or if you need a refresher, you should start with our `Introduction to R <intr/index.html>`__ (`pdf </pdf/Rintro.pdf>`__)

There are two version of this website, the `"terra" version </terra/index.html>`_ and the `"raster" version </raster/index.html>`_. The "terra" package is new a *R* package that aims to replace "raster". "terra" is easier to use, has more functionality, and it is faster. So if in doubt use the `terra` version.
